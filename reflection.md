- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


I think inheritance is really cool! I think it is really useful to be able to modify an existing parent via a child and the relationship between them is super interesting. It makes a lot of sense to me. I was really happy, because I felt like I actually fully understood what I was doing for this assignment, which is different from the start of the semester. I would say that reading the Java style pages on Oracle was super helpful, and occasionally searching for examples of usage in Geeks for Geeks to be sure I was doing things properly. I would advise someone taking this course to not give up, as it really does make more sense and get "easier" in time.
